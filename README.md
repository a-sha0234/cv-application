# Cv application creator

## The project
This project allows a user to fill in details about themselves eg: work experience, general information etc  

## Goals
My initial goal was practice some basic react skills that I learnt as this was my very first react project. I also wanted to <br/>
try using Material-Ui library, as it complements react well in the way its structured as components that are customisable.

## what i learnt in this project
In this project I picked up the basic idea of functional components, props, states, form handeling and component structure. <br/>
